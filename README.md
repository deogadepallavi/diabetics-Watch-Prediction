# Diabetes Watch Prediction

# Project Objective
The goal of this project is to predict the likelihood of an individual being diabetic based on health indicators from the 2015 Behavioural Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) dataset. The aim is to assist healthcare professionals in identifying high-risk individuals for timely intervention.

# Methods Used
* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree Classifier
* K-Nearest Neighbors
* XGBoost
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* Random Forest with hyperparameter tuning

# Technologies:
* Python
* Pandas, NumPy for data processing
* Scikit-learn, XGBoost for machine learning
* Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization
* Jupyter Notebook for experimentation

# Project Description
This project involves using machine learning models to predict diabetes risk based on health-related data. Various models were evaluated for performance, and hyperparameter tuning was applied to enhance accuracy. The dataset presented an imbalance between diabetic and non-diabetic samples, which was addressed using data balancing techniques. After model comparisons, the Random Forest model, optimized through tuning, yielded the best results.

# Conclusion
The project successfully predicted diabetes risk using multiple machine learning models, with Random Forest showing the highest accuracy. This predictive approach can be a valuable tool in healthcare, helping to identify at-risk individuals and potentially improving health outcomes through early detection. Future work includes expanding datasets and exploring deep learning methods for enhanced prediction.
